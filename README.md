<h1>Welcome to our accessibility project!</h1>

<p>Our team found out that sometimes it is very hard to find restaurant menus and we wanted to make this task easier for some people, mainly blind people. And so we decided to develop an app, aiming for accessibility and inclusion, that helps people find restaurant menus.</p>

<p>If you would like to download our app, just click in here: (just a sec, we are still developing!) -> (Available for iOS)</p>

<p>We hope you like our app!</p>
